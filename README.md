/*****************************************************************************
 * This is my solution to the problem of finding the number of disjoint regions
 * in a matrix.
 *
 * It works also for matrixes with elements of more than 2 values (not limited
 * to 0,1) and regardless of whether the matrix is square or not (N x M are ok).
 *
 *
 * TASK DESCRIPTION:
 * You can find it in the docs/ directory.
 *
 *
 * NOTE:
 * If you want to run this program as a shell script, first you need to make
 * the disjoint-regions.php file executable.
 *
 * If you DON'T want to run this program as a shell script (won't work under
 * the Windows OS), please remove the first line of the disjoint-regions.php
 * file.
